# InstaVsCode

Hey! This Open Source Project Is For The Insta Coders, which means those who want to use Instagram while using VS Code. This extension allows you to view Instagram Reels directly in your VS Code sidebar, so you can stay focused on coding without switching tabs.

## Features

- **Instagram Login**: Log in to your Instagram account directly from VS Code.
- **Reels in Sidebar**: View your Instagram Reels in a dedicated sidebar.
- **Auto-Scroll**: Automatically scroll through reels without lifting a finger.
- **Toggleable Sidebar**: Easily show/hide the Instagram Reels sidebar.

- **Instagram Account**: You need an Instagram account to log in and view reels.
- **Instagram App**: You must create an Instagram app on the [Facebook Developer Portal](https://developers.facebook.com/) to get `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.

## Extension Settings

## Known Issues
